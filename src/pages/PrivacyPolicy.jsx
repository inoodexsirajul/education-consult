            connect with us through social media. INSAF Immigration does not
            store any sensitive information that is not crucial in its dealings,
            or without the consent of its users. You will need to verify
            yourself if you want us to work with you—false identities or

            We take reasonable steps to protect the Personal Information we hold
            against interference, loss, unauthorised access, usage, modification
            or disclosure, and other misuses.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4 font-mont">
            The steps we take include:

          <ul className="list-disc pl-8 space-y-3 text-lg mb-6 font-mont">
            <li>Maintenance of computer technology</li>
            <li>
              People and process-based security measures like firewalls, network

              measures where information is held in electronic form
            </li>
            <li>
              Regular updates to security systems and configurations to protect
              our systems from malicious activities

            <li>
              Restriction of access to data to only those staff members that
              need access to carry out our business activities
            </li>

              as confidential

            However, you should be aware that if you submit information to us
            electronically then be aware the internet is not a secure
            environment. We take reasonable steps to provide a secure channel
            for receiving information but cannot absolutely protect Personal
            Information before it reaches us.

            When the Personal Information that we collect is no longer required,
